1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to collaborate with other people who don't work on the same system as
I do.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Suppose two people are working on the same file and one has finished and other is still
working. If Git automatically pull from remote then the person who was still working 
on the file will find that his file has been modified. This is not something he would 
want. So in such cases he will pull when he thinks he is done with his work.
