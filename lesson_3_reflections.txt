1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to collaborate with other people who don't work on the same system as
I do.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Suppose two people are working on the same file and one has finished and other is still
working. If Git automatically pull from remote then the person who was still working 
on the file will find that his file has been modified. This is not something he would 
want. So in such cases he will pull when he thinks he is done with his work.



3.  Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?
Fork is a copy of someone's remote on github itself. We want to create fork when we
don't have permissions to commit to a remote. 
Clone is the copy of remote on local system. We want to create clone when we want 
to edit files on our system instead of github and we have permissions to commit to 
the remote. Either we created it or as a contributor.
Branches are just label we give to commits. We create branches when we want to work
on a new feature or something experimental. Branches are present within a single
repository.



4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored 
locally?
Due to this it is possible to run the git fetch command to update the position
of origin/master branch and then we can merge master and origin/master and
resolve any conflicts.
